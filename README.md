My custom nixos install flake

## Why?
I've always found the minimal nixos install lacking in terms of features and thought it would be a great idea to be able to install using a custom environment.

It is mainly inspired by the Fedora Sway installer iso, which I loved. Being mininal but practical is the goal.
